This project aims to provide educational establishments a tool to track attendance data for classes in an environment that fits well with the commonly used applications, such as Google Spreadsheet.

We have to mention some of the currently existing limitations that were implemented for the particular commercial use case this project was created for, namely:
1) Teacher and student names cannot contain symblols.
2) Student names have to contain at least one space.
3) Teacher names, student names and surnames start with capital letters.
4) It is assumed that the input student name is only two words long. The code will be changed to reflect longer surnames/names/patronymics combinations.
5) The code requires at least one time slot to be chosen and it presupposes that these timeslots are set at one hour intervals. Feel free to change the intervals on your own or change them into text input fields all together.

As a lot of this project was created for a specific use case, there may be changes required to make it work in a different scenario.
