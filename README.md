## 📌 About the Project
This project aims to provide educational establishments a tool to track attendance data for classes in an environment that fits well with the commonly used applications, such as Google Spreadsheet.

## ⚠️ Limitations
Currently, this tool has some constraints due to its original commercial use case:

**1) Teacher and student names cannot contain symblols.
2) Student names have to contain at least one space.
3) Teacher names, student names and surnames start with capital letters.
4) It is assumed that the input student name is only two words long. The code will be changed to reflect longer surnames/names/patronymics combinations.
5) The code requires at least one time slot to be chosen and it presupposes that these timeslots are set at one hour intervals. Feel free to change the intervals on your own or change them into text input fields all together.****

## 🔧 Customization
Since this project was designed for a specific use case, modifications may be required for different environments.
